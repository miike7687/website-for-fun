          This little guy always gets dressed up for fancy occasions. He's not
          as cute as Riley, but he will do the trick. On this specific day, he
          was celebrating Christmas even though he's a Jewish dog.

          Beaches are the most peaceful place to be. I could live, eat, relax,
          and sleep on a beach and be the happiest person in the world.

          Grey's Anatomy is a show about doctors being in love, dramatic, and/or getting sick/injured. There are lots of Mc's and elevators and quick looks. There are people who fall down out of nowhere.

          Will you accept this rose? This ABC hit show features one man looking for the woman of his dreams. At the end of every episode, certain women do not receive roses and they are booted.

          Alyssa has been skating since she was 3 months old. That's a lie. But she's been skating for a long time and she can be in the Olympics if she really wanted to.
